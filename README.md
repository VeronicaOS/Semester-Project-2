# BidStorm

For this project I was tasked to create a blog site for an auction site and choose the design myself.

## Description

This was the second project exam a Noroff and the goal was to take all the skills learned throughout the last few semesters to create this website. I started off with the design in Figma and then I made the blog site using HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

## Brief

An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.
